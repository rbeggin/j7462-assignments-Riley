I looked at NPR Visuals' Github repository on "A Silent Epidemic," their incredible visual story about how public schools are failing students. I chose it because I read the story the week it came out and remember thinking it was really cool, and I wondered how they did it. I also interned at NPR this summer and got a chance to sit down with Alyson Hurt in late August, so I was interested to see what she was working on at the time that we spoke. To be honest, I didn't really understand most of the jargon in the Github page, so if I were to sit down with the team and ask questions I'd have them walk me through the process of making the visualization. I'd also be curious to hear what a Flask app and LESS files are -- compared to HTML, Javascript and Python, those were two of the things I have never even heard of.
